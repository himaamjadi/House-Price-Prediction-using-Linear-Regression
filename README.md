# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices using Linear Regression with the Boston Housing Dataset. It involves data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to estimate house prices based on features like the number of rooms, square footage, and location.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using pip:

\```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
\```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

\```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/House-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression.git
\```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

\```bash
cd House-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
\```

3. Open and run the notebook `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` in Google Colab.

### Usage

- Open the notebook `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` in Google Colab.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
